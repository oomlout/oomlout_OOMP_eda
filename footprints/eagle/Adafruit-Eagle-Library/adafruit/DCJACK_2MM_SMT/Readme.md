&lt;p&gt;Note: Small tRestrict polygon's were added to the ground pads to improve solderability when this part is used in combination with a ground pour.  By default, Eagle will product four large bridges to the ground pour significantly increasing the heat distribution on the pads and preventing lead-free solder from reflowing in certain situations.
